A comparative analysis of constituencies in England and Wales.

## Quickstart
See the [presentation](presentation/presentation.pdf) for a quick view of the results, the [report](report/report.pdf) for a more in-depth overview and the [notebook](analysis.ipynb) for the code.

## Description
This is a cluster analysis project in which I compare all constituencies in England and Wales based on eight different variables related to demographics, business, qualifications and amenities. The use case would then be to find similar constituencies as a given location in England or Wales.

All data has been downloaded from the [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk), and data on constituencies and their latitudes and longitudes are from [doogal.co.uk](https://www.doogal.co.uk).

This project was the capstone project in the IBM applied data science specialisation on Coursera.
