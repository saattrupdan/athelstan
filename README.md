A comparative analysis of constituencies in England and Wales. See [presentation/presentation.pdf] for a quick view of the results, [report/report.pdf] for a slightly more in-depth report and [analysis.ipynb] for the notebook containing the code.

This is a cluster analysis project in which I compare all constituencies in England and Wales based on eight different variables related to demographics, business, qualifications and amenities. The use case would then be to find similar constituencies as a given location in England or Wales.

All data has been downloaded from the [ons.gov.uk](Office for National Statistics), and data on constituencies and their latitudes and longitudes are from [doogal.co.uk].

This project was the capstone project in the IBM applied data science specialisation on Coursera.
