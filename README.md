A comparative analysis of constituencies in England and Wales. See <tt>presentation/presentation.pdf</tt> for a quick view of the results, <tt>report/report.pdf</tt> for a slightly more indepth report and <tt>analysis.ipynb</tt> for the notebook containing the code.

This is a cluster analysis project in which I compare all constituencies in England and Wales based on eight different variables related to demographics, business, qualifications and amenities. The use case would then be to find similar constituencies as a given location in England or Wales.

All data has been downloaded from the Office for National Statistics (ons.gov.uk), and data on constituencies and their latitudes and longitudes are from doogal.co.uk.

This project was the capstone project in the IBM applied data science specialisation on Coursera.
