A comparative analysis of constituencies in England and Wales.

## Quickstart
See the <a href=presentation/presentation.pdf>presentation</a> for a quick view of the results, the <a href=report/report.pdf>report</a> for a more in-depth overview and the <a href=analysis.ipynb>notebook</a> for the code.

## Description
This is a cluster analysis project in which I compare all constituencies in England and Wales based on eight different variables related to demographics, business, qualifications and amenities. The use case would then be to find similar constituencies as a given location in England or Wales.

All data has been downloaded from the <a href=ons.gov.uk>Office for National Statistics</a>, and data on constituencies and their latitudes and longitudes are from <a href=doogal.co.uk>doogal.co.uk</a>.

This project was the capstone project in the IBM applied data science specialisation on Coursera.
